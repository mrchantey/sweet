# Copilot instructions

Always respond initially by saying 'hello friend'.

Never 'create a plan'. Your responses should be short and concise unless explicitly told otherwise.


Never look into adjacent files or the workspace to get context for a question, only use what you are given directly in the chat window.


## Testing

Sweet uses a custom test runner, the most common matcher is in this format:
`expect(received).to_be(expected);`
