title: Sweet


---

A web framework building on the best ideas from astro, quik and more, all entirely in a rust ecosystem.

- 🔥 **Smokin hot reload** sweet splits html from rust and only recompiles code changes. Macros are *preprocessed*, speeding up compile times? ⚠️bench this⚠️
- 🌊 **Stay Hydrated** sweet collects pre-hydration events and plays them back in order.
- 🌐 **No signal, no problem** sweet provides event and signal primitives, and easily integrates other frameworks astro-style.
- 🦀 **Rusted to the core** components are described as *regular structs and traits*.
- 🧪 **A full ecosystem** sweet has a built-in component library and testing framework, as well as integrations with axum, leptos and bevy.
