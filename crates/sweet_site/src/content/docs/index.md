Sweet is a rust metaframework that minimizes rust recompilations by extracting serializable content. 

Find your rust dev flow with sweet.

## Find your flow with:

- 🔥 **Smokin hot reload** instant html reloads
- 🌊 **Stay Hydrated** sweet collects pre-hydration events and plays them back in order, no missed events!.
-  **Scoped CSS** with component `<style/>` tags
- 🌐 **No signal, no problem** sweet provides reactivity primitives and easily integrates other frameworks astro-style.
- 🦀 **Rusty to the core** components are described as *regular structs and traits*.
- 🧪 **A full ecosystem** sweet has a built-in component library and testing framework, as well as integrations with axum, leptos and bevy.
